            <h1 class="major">Last but not least - Module Reflection</h1>

            <p>This reflection summarises my engagement with the <strong>Intelligent Agents</strong> module, including contributions to discussions, practical exercises, a collaborative team project, and an individual development challenge. The module helped me develop key skills in agent design, communication, and evaluation, alongside deepening my understanding of ethical and technical considerations in intelligent systems.</p>

            <h2>Learning Through Discussion and Practical Activities</h2>

            <p>In the opening discussion on <strong>Agent-Based Systems</strong>, I explored how decentralised agents support dynamic, autonomous coordination in domains like logistics and smart manufacturing. Peer input reinforced key ideas around resilience, semantic interoperability, and the growing role of explainable AI. This laid a solid foundation for understanding the motivations behind agent-based computing.</p>

            <p>The second discussion focused on <strong>Agent Communication Languages</strong>, particularly KQML and FIPA-ACL. I analysed the trade-offs between semantic richness and implementation complexity, and how hybrid architectures can balance these tensions. Peer responses emphasised the need for layered communication protocols and further enriched my perspective on interoperability and scalability challenges.</p>

            <p>Due to time constraints, I did not participate in the <strong>Deep Learning Ethics</strong> discussion. The absence of earlier feedback made the forum feel less engaging at the time, which discouraged further participation. In hindsight, I recognise the importance of staying consistent in academic engagement regardless of peer response, and I intend to address this proactively in future modules.</p>

            <p>Among the key exercises, the <strong>KQML/KIF agent dialogue</strong> task helped me understand structured agent communication and knowledge exchange. I designed a simple conversation where a procurement agent (Alice) queried a stock agent (Bob) using formal performatives and logical assertions. This exercise made abstract agent concepts more tangible and applicable.</p>

            <p>Creating <strong>constituency-based parse trees</strong> for NLP tasks further expanded my appreciation of how intelligent systems process language. This syntactic analysis reinforced my understanding of how agents interpret and respond to human input—a vital capability in dialogue systems and virtual assistants.</p>

            <p>For the <strong>deep learning application</strong> activity, I examined deepfakes and their socio-technical impacts. This task encouraged me to think critically about real-world consequences of advanced AI, including ethical risks, misinformation, and privacy violations. I found it valuable to balance technical knowledge with broader societal awareness.</p>

            <h2>Team Project and Individual Development</h2>

            <p>Our group project—<strong>Digital Forensics: Autonomous Verification Agents</strong>—focused on developing a Chrome browser extension to pre-screen file downloads using lightweight AI and rule-based scanning. We proposed a multi-layered agent architecture using Python, scikit-learn, and yara-python, combined with PostgreSQL for secure logging. The goal was to block malware threats before they reached endpoints, improving compliance, efficiency, and protection. My contributions included technical research, architecture design, and outlining the communication and filtering pipeline.</p>

            <p>The project deepened my understanding of real-world agent deployment, particularly in cybersecurity contexts. It also developed my collaboration skills, as our group divided responsibilities effectively and maintained regular communication throughout. Seeing our design evolve into a structured solution helped build confidence in both my conceptual and practical abilities.</p>

            <p>The most challenging part of the module came with the <strong>individual presentation</strong>, where I had to implement the intelligent agent from our team project independently. This required re-engaging with Python and deepening my understanding of Chrome extension development, API handling, and anomaly detection pipelines. I had to revisit skills I had not used in a while—especially in debugging client-server interactions and JSON communication. Despite the steep learning curve, it was highly rewarding to see the prototype come together. This experience showed me the importance of flexibility, perseverance, and self-driven learning in technical work.</p>

            <h2>Personal Reflections and Future Application</h2>

            <p>Looking back, this module significantly enhanced my practical and conceptual understanding of intelligent agents. I have learned how to design agents, evaluate their communication mechanisms, and assess their ethical and societal implications. I also recognised the importance of maintaining consistent engagement, even when motivation is low, as meaningful learning often emerges through continued effort.</p>

            <p>The challenges I faced—particularly during the individual build—taught me to trust my ability to research and learn independently, especially when revisiting older programming skills. Going forward, I feel more confident applying these insights in real-world contexts such as digital forensics, secure systems design, and AI governance.</p>

            <p>In summary, this module bridged theory and practice, individual and collaborative learning, and technical development with critical reflection. It has been a demanding but transformative learning experience.</p>
