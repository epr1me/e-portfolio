							<h1 class="major">Unit 6 - Team Project: Airbnb business analysis using a data science approach</h1>
							<p>This unit focused on analyzing Airbnb&rsquo;s NYC dataset to address a business question, applying data science techniques, and preparing an analytical report. The project was completed as part of a collaborative team effort, emphasizing technical skills, critical thinking, and professional communication.</p>

							<h2>Team Dynamics</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>The team displayed strong communication and collaboration, facilitated by a WhatsApp group for seamless coordination.</li>
								<li>Each member contributed meaningfully, with one member proactively completing significant portions of the report based on team input, which streamlined the final submission process.</li>
								<li>I took the initiative to create the WhatsApp group for better communication and ensured all team members were actively involved in discussions and task updates.</li>
								<li>My role included critically analyzing the data preprocessing and contributing ideas for the exploratory data analysis (EDA), ensuring that the findings addressed the posed business question effectively.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
							<h3>1. Applicability of Machine Learning and Data Science</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Explored the challenges and opportunities presented by real-world datasets, such as handling missing data, identifying relevant features, and choosing the right analysis methods.</li>
								<li>Addressed a business-relevant question using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and unsupervised machine learning techniques (e.g., clustering).</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>2. Teamwork and Collaboration in a Professional Setting</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Demonstrated effective teamwork by setting clear goals, dividing responsibilities, and maintaining active communication.</li>
								<li>I actively participated in brainstorming sessions, helping the team refine the business question and methodology.</li>
								<li>Reflected on the importance of pre-assigning tasks and setting clear deadlines for improved efficiency in future collaborations.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Key Artefacts</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Business Question:</strong> Investigated how booking patterns vary across NYC neighborhoods and factors influencing them.</li>
								<li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Conducted EDA, data cleaning, and clustering to derive actionable insights. Visualized results through compelling charts.</li>
								<li><strong>Analytical Report:</strong> Delivered a concise 1,000-word report highlighting the analysis, insights, and recommendations for Airbnb, complemented by an appendix with Python code.</li>
								<li><strong>My Contribution:</strong> Played a key role in ensuring high-quality data preprocessing and contributed to creating visualizations that effectively communicated key findings.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong communication and critical thinking ensured cohesive team efforts.</li>
								<li><strong>Improvement Areas:</strong> Improved time management and task scheduling for future projects.</li>
