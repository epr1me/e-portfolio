						<h2>Critical Reflection on Learning and Development in Research Methods and Methodology</h2>

						<p>This reflection offers a critical analysis of my academic and professional development over the course of the Research Methods and Methodology module. Drawing upon the reflective e-Portfolio activities, statistical exercises, major summative submissions (the Literature Review and Research Proposal), and associated feedback, I explore the evolution of my skills, conceptual understanding, and future trajectory. The process was both enlightening and at times challenging, requiring continual engagement with complex academic expectations and applied methodological rigour.</p>

						<h3>Literature Review: Insights and Limitations</h3>

						<p>My literature review explored the role of AI-based assistive technologies in supporting physically disabled and elderly populations. Feedback highlighted that while my written expression and structural coherence were strong, there was insufficient synthesis of contrasting views and limited diversity of sources. As noted in the summative feedback, my approach compartmentalised strengths and limitations into separate sections rather than embedding a more integrated critical discussion within each thematic area.</p>

						<p>In hindsight, this structure limited my ability to engage in the kind of comparative evaluation that would elevate the criticality of my work. While I relied heavily on a small number of methodologically rigorous studies, this narrow base restricted broader contextual debate. Furthermore, the feedback underscored the importance of applying more regular and varied citation—a weakness that I now recognise as a symptom of insufficient source mapping during the early stages of review writing.</p>

						<p>In response, I revisited my literature management strategy and refined my synthesis technique to focus more sharply on methodological critique and epistemological tension within the reviewed studies. This has informed my future writing by embedding citation planning and critical comparison earlier in the review process.</p>

						<h3>Research Proposal: Design, Differentiation, and Evaluation</h3>

						<p>My research proposal advanced the work begun in the literature review but pivoted to a distinct context: the integration of demand forecasting and personalised recommendation systems in nutraceutical e-commerce using machine learning. Formative feedback advised me to ensure that this project built upon, rather than overlapped with, the literature review content. I took this on board by adopting a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology and clearly defining my research question, technical methods, and ethical considerations in a commercial rather than clinical setting.</p>

						<p>This proposal benefitted from clearer methodological alignment than my literature review. The technical detail—particularly the integration of time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) and neural collaborative filtering—demonstrated a stronger grasp of research design logic. I also took care to operationalise ethical concerns such as GDPR compliance, bias mitigation, and user validation through informed consent, which marked a significant improvement in my ability to apply ethical frameworks to AI research.</p>

						<p>Nonetheless, one critical limitation was the breadth of the proposal’s scope. While ambitious, combining demand forecasting and personalisation within a single system risked diffusion of focus. Though I clearly articulated deliverables and timelines, in practice this project would require rigorous prioritisation and possibly reduced technical breadth to maintain feasibility within the MSc time constraints.</p>

						<h3>Statistical Analysis Skills: Progress and Pitfalls</h3>

						<p>The statistical exercises in Units 8 and 9 were initially daunting. Prior to the module, my familiarity with statistical tests and SPSS was minimal. Engaging with the worksheets—particularly those on t-tests, normality testing, and Pearson correlation—allowed me to gain foundational competence. I particularly benefitted from repeated exposure to interpreting SPSS outputs and articulating statistical findings in academic language.</p>

						<p>That said, one key area for critical reflection was my initial overreliance on p-values and the binary logic of “significant vs. not significant.” I now understand that this interpretation is reductive and fails to account for effect size, power, and confidence intervals—concepts that are vital in producing nuanced analysis. Moreover, while I developed competence in basic inferential statistics, I remain aware of the gap between operational proficiency and true statistical literacy. This is an area I intend to pursue further through supplementary workshops and practical applications in future research.</p>

						<h3>Reflecting on the Research Process and Methodological Development</h3>

						<p>The module’s structured progression through philosophical foundations, research design, ethics, and data analysis provided a scaffolded learning experience that clarified the relationship between theory and method. Early reflective tasks encouraged me to explore my positionality as a researcher—particularly the tension between my professional interest in AI and the need for ethical caution in applied health contexts.</p>

						<p>One of the most illuminating moments came during the Research Proposal’s ethical considerations section, where I grappled with algorithmic fairness and the limitations of AI in health recommendation systems. This prompted me to consider not only statistical bias but also epistemic injustice—how marginalised users might be excluded by design if not accounted for in training data or validation feedback loops.</p>

						<p>However, the module did not always foreground critical or post-positivist perspectives, and I found myself seeking external readings to explore participatory research, co-design methods, and the ethics of datafication more fully. This lack of engagement with critical research traditions is a notable limitation, particularly given the increasing intersection of AI and vulnerable populations.</p>

						<h3>Professional Development: SWOT and Skills Matrix Reflection</h3>

						<p>The Professional Skills Matrix and SWOT analysis prompted a strategic reflection on my development. Key strengths identified included my written communication, conceptual clarity, and project management skills—each reinforced by the positive feedback on tone and organisation in both major assignments. However, weaknesses were also evident: an initial lack of methodological clarity, narrow sourcing strategies, and limited statistical fluency.</p>

						<p>My action plan focused on three key areas: (1) enhancing source diversity through broader database usage and citation management tools; (2) improving data analysis skills through SPSS and Python workshops; and (3) strengthening my ability to integrate theoretical and practical elements in research design. These goals are already shaping my dissertation preparation and influencing the way I approach collaborative tasks in my professional role.</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>

						<p>The Research Methods and Methodology module has catalysed significant intellectual and professional growth. While I have made measurable progress in research design, critical writing, and statistical analysis, the module also exposed enduring challenges, particularly around synthesis, methodological depth, and epistemological awareness.</p>

						<p>Going forward, I will continue to refine my research practice by applying critical reflexivity, prioritising methodological rigour, and engaging with broader ethical and epistemic frameworks. Ultimately, this module has equipped me not only with practical tools but with a deeper scholarly orientation—essential for both academic success and ethical, impactful professional practice.</p>
